### Project Overview  

This project involves:  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The provided dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key patterns and insights from the dataset were explored to guide the modeling process.  
3. **Model Training**: A Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated using the following regularization techniques:  
   - **Lasso Regression**  
   - **Ridge Regression**  
   - **ElasticNet Regression**  

   Metrics used for evaluation:  
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
   - **RÂ² Score**  

4. **Model Serialization**: The trained model was serialized using `pickle` for seamless deployment.  
5. **Flask Application**: A Flask-based web app was created to allow users to predict outcomes by providing input feature values.  

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preparation to flask app for prediction

### Information about the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset : 
<br>
<br>
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.
<br>
<br>
122 instances for each region.
<br>
<br>
The period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class) The 244 instances have been classified into fire(138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.
